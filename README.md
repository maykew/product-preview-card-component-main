## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I intend to develop more pages using only HTML and CSS to consolidate the concepts of "HTML5 Semantic" and "Responsive Design".

### Useful resources

- [MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - MDN Web Docs has the most up-to-date and accurate information and the content is presented in an easy-to-understand manner;
- [Reset CSS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on;
